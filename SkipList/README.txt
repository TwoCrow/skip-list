Please note:
SkipList.java is the only .java file in this project created by me. This project was a class assignment, and was only testing our ability to create this quirky data structure.

To run SkipList.java:

- Navigate to the SkipList folder, which contains all necessary files to run it.
- Type 'javac SkipList.java Input01.java' without quotes. Press quotes.
- Type 'java Input01' without quotes. Press enter.
- The program will run!

The sample file, Input01.java, is included to showcase how input files are meant to be structured. You can create your own input files so long as they follow Input01.java's
general format. Input01.java will take a while to process as it inserts 1,000,000 random integers, and picks a random integer that was used in the insertion to find. This is
meant to demonstrate the O(log(n)) search capabilities of skiplists; it will take a long time to populate, but not very long to find.
